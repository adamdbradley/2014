# GenieJS

[GenieJS](http://kent.doddsfamily.us/genie) is a JavaScript library committed
to improving user experience by empowering users to interact with web apps
using the keyboard (better than cryptic shortcuts).

My presentation had no slides, but we did have some fun doing some air
squats, stretching, using Gmail, and telling stories. We also looked at
the [Genie Workshop](http://kent.doddsfamily.us/genie/workshop/).
Relive the action through
[the tweets](http://topsy.com/s?q=%23geniejs&mintime=1407934830&maxtime=1408194030)

I didn't use slides, but if you want to see some I made some for a
previous talk on [Slid.es](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/genie).
