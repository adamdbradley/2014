Thanks to everyone that was able to attend my 'Intro to Angular' talk at MidwestJS I hope you found it useful. I enjoyed giving it!

Here's the code for IntroTo Angular that we live coded

And the AngularAgility project that makes CRUD apps dead simple:

- Drastically reduce the amount of boilerplate, repetitive, error-prone HTML required to produce forms, labels and validation messages.
- Automatically generate Angular.js fields for use in form validation, their error messages AND labels.
- On blur and on invalid submit attempt showing of validation messages.
- Form extensions programatically extends forms at myForm.$aaFormExtensions = {...}
- Code is cleaner and easier to read. Form Extensions is DSL that distills your HTML down to only what is required.
- Feel free to use full blown markup whenever you want complete control.
- Mix and match the directive components of Form Extensions to get exactly what you'd like for each situation.
- It does exactly what you want: Everything is overridable on a global and per-instance basis through a rich provider model.
